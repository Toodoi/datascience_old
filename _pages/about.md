Hi! My name's Todd. I used to work in economic and public policy and have always had a deep interest in programming. After returning to Australia from a year abroad backpacking due to Coronavirus, I've had the opportunity to expand on my programming and statistics skills and make the shift into data science which I am very passionate about. I am currently studying full time and looking for employment opportunities in the area of data science or any other jobs where I can use data driven techniques to solve problems.
